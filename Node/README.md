### Client-server architecture

It is a producer/consumer computing architecture where the server acts as the producer and the client as a consumer.\
The server houses and provides high-end, computing-intensive services to the client on demand.\
These services can include application access, storage, file sharing, printer access and/or direct access to the server’s raw computing power.\
Client/server architecture works when the client computer sends a resource or process request to the server over the network connection, which is then processed and delivered to the client.\
A server computer can manage several clients simultaneously, whereas one client can be connected to several servers at a time, each providing a different set of services.\
In its simplest form, the internet is also based on client/server architecture where web servers serve many simultaneous users with website data.

### HTTP

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.\
This is the foundation for data communication for the World Wide Web (i.e. internet) since 1990.\
HTTP is a generic and stateless protocol which can be used for other purposes as well using extensions of its request methods, error codes, and headers.


A **Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)** provides a simple and extensible means for identifying a resource (straight from RFC 3986). It’s just an identifier; don’t overthink it.

A **Uniform Resource Locator (URL)** is an identifier that tells you how to get to it.
