**Prerequisite:**
- clone repo with a server;
- install dependencies and run server
  - `npm install`
  - `npm run start`
- now you have a backend for your application
  - go to the url: http://localhost:3000/api
- you should see page with all APIs

**Project structure requirements**

1. Create new folders and jsx files for each component
```
src
|-- components
|   |-- Login
|   | |__ Login.jsx
|   |
|   |-- Registration
|   | |__ Registration.jsx
|   |
|   |-- CourseInfo
|   | |__ CourseInfo.jsx
|   |
|   |__ ...
|__ ...
```
2. For sending requests to API you should use fetch or axios.
